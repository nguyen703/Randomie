Hi ;)

This is a self-starting project with the final goal a little bit ridiculous: Randomize people in the image and choose the one who wins (or loses ðŸ˜ˆ)

Approach: put a sticker on each person and randomize! That's it.

Cocoapods package:
- Loady: button animation
- Chameleon: generate beautiful UI Colors

LET'S FIND SOMEONE WHO HAS TO PICK THE FOOD OR BUY A DINNER FOR US, YAYY
